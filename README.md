# Image Editor
An image editor.
Coded in Python using PySimpleGUI and Pillow Imaging Library (PIL).
This program should only work with PNG images. JPG images are currently untested.
It works by taking in RGB values from each pixel, storing it in nested lists. It then changes the values inside these nested lists using different mathematical formulas, changing the image.
Features currently include a working GUI, and a Mirror, Grey, Invert, and Revert to Original image feature.
